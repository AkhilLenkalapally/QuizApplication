# QuizApplication
Welcome to my Quiz Application! ðŸŽ‰ This project was built using the Java programming language, and I had an amazing time developing it. The application is a simple yet functional quiz system designed to test usersâ€™ knowledge through multiple-choice questions

---

## Features  
- **Multiple-choice questions**: Each question comes with multiple answer options, and users can select their choice.  
- **Score tracking**: The application keeps track of your score and displays it at the end.  

---

## How It Works  
1. The application presents a series of questions.  
2. Each question has multiple options (numbered).  
3. Users input the number corresponding to their answer.  
4. The application provides immediate feedback (correct or incorrect).  
5. At the end of the quiz, the total score is displayed.

## Technologies Used  
- **Java**: Core programming language used to build the application.  
- **Scanner**: Used for input handling in a command-line interface.

## Future Enhancements  
Here are some ideas to expand this project:  
- Easy navigation: Simple text-based interface for easy interaction.  
- Replay functionality(if added): Restart the quiz to try again!  
- Add a **database** to store quiz questions and high scores.  
- Build a **web version** of the quiz using frameworks like Spring Boot.  
- Introduce a **timer** for each question to make it more challenging.  
- Add support for **different quiz categories** (e.g., Science, History, Tech).

2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).  
3. Compile and run the main class (`QuizApp.java`).  
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to enjoy the quiz!
